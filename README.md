# 🎮 Connect Four with Python, Pygame & AI

An interactive version of the classic **Connect Four** game, built with **Python** and **Pygame**, featuring a clean GUI and an intelligent AI opponent using the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning**.

## 🧠 AI Difficulty Levels:
- **Easy** – Random AI
- **Medium** – Minimax with shallow depth
- **Hard** – Minimax with deeper search and Alpha-Beta pruning

## 🎮 Game Modes:
- Player vs Player  
- Player vs AI

## 🖥️ Features:
- Smooth graphical user interface using **Pygame**
- Real-time move previews
- Win and draw detection
- Reset and replay functionality
- Object-Oriented clean codebase

## 🤖 Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning:
The AI uses the **Minimax** algorithm to evaluate game states and simulate optimal moves. **Alpha-Beta pruning** is applied to ignore unpromising branches, improving performance significantly at deeper levels.

## 🚀 How to Run:
```bash
pip install pygame
python connect_four.py
